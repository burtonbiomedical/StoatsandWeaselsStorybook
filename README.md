# Stoats and Weasels StoryBook

I built this web application for my friends with Node.js/Express with Google OAuth using Passports and a MongoDB database. I used Handlebars.js for template rendering,
and Materialize CSS for styling. This project was completed as part of an online course with Udemy, which can be found <a href="https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-express-mongodb-dev-to-deployment">here.</a>
